# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for Image Upload Issues

## âœ… What I Fixed:
1. **ImagePreview Component** - Added safety checks to prevent empty src errors
2. **Posts API** - Added fallback when Supabase isn't configured yet
3. **Error Handling** - Images will now work even without Supabase setup

## ðŸ”§ To Fix the Supabase Error:

### Option 1: Quick Test (No Supabase needed)
The app will now work without Supabase! Images will be stored as file names and show placeholders.

### Option 2: Full Supabase Setup (For real image storage)

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in your project root:
```bash
# Add these lines to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url-here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key-here"
```

2. **Get Supabase credentials:**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Go to Settings â†’ API
   - Copy the Project URL and anon public key

3. **Create storage bucket:**
   - Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
   - Create new bucket named `post-images`
   - Set as **Public bucket** âœ…

## ðŸŽ‰ Test It Now!
1. Restart your dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Go to `/app/create`
3. Try creating a post with images
4. Check your profile to see the post!

The image errors should be gone! ðŸŽŠ
