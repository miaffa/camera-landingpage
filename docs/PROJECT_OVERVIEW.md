# **Questions**

## 1. **Target Market & User Segmentation**

- Who exactly is your primary user base, and how do they differ in needs?
    
    Photographers/videographers, creatives, amateurs. They differ in the type of gear/amount of gear needed to rent 
    
    - Some will want to rent out their gear when they don‚Äôt have a shoot to make extra money
    - Others want to get started in the photography field without having to buy thier own equipment
- Are you targeting **professional photographers/videographers** who own expensive gear ($5K+ cameras) and want ROI on idle equipment?
    
    yes
    
- **Semi-professional/enthusiast creators** who occasionally need gear upgrades for specific projects?
    
    yes
    
- **Hobbyists** who want to try before buying expensive equipment?
    
    yes
    
- Or all three segments with different value propositions for each?
    
    We want all of these forms of creators
    

## 2. **Trust & Insurance Model**

- How will you handle the biggest barrier to peer-to-peer rentals - trust and liability?
    
    Using connections, reviews, and id verification to ensure that both parties can trust each other
    
- Will you partner with existing insurance providers (like Atlaas, BorrowFox) or build in-house coverage?
    - Probably
- What's your damage/theft claim process - who handles disputes, how quickly are claims resolved?
    
    
- How do you verify gear condition and prevent fraud (both ways)?
    - verify id‚Äôs and images from other renters to ensure camera gear is in the quality that is stated
- What happens if a $10K camera gets damaged during a rental?

## 3. **Revenue Model & Unit Economics**

- What's your path to profitability and how do you balance competitive pricing with sustainable margins?
    
    Service fee
    
- What percentage commission do you take from rentals (5%? 15%? 25%?)?
    
    10% ‚Äî> 5% from renter, 5% from rentee
    
- Additional revenue from insurance fees, payment processing, premium listings?
    
    in the future, payment processing
    
    maybe let renters pay extra to boost their gear
    
- How do you compete with established players like ShareGrid, KitSplit, or LensRentals on pricing?
    
    10% not 15% so 5% less commission
    
- What's your customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value projection?
    
    CAC - low ‚Äî> personal connections and social media marketing
    
    LVP ‚Äî> higher
    

## 4. **Geographic Strategy & Local Density**

- How do you solve the chicken-and-egg problem and achieve critical mass in each market?
    - [**Subsidizing Early Users**: Platforms can subsidize early users to participate in the platform until network effects become self-sustaining. This can involve direct cash payments, free services, preferential treatment, or valuable content access. The key is to reward actions that drive network value, such as content creation or transaction completion.](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=40a571431b61c06bde843323215a0f4882a6174413af769159cc21114e7bd102JmltdHM9MTc1Nzg5NDQwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=20728943-00e2-6fae-31da-9f24018d6eaa&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9yZXBvcnRpbmd0cmVuZC50aXN0b3J5LmNvbS8xMTI&ntb=1)
    - [**Focusing on the Harder Side First**: Platforms should identify which side is harder to acquire and focus on that side first. For example, in a marketplace, if it's harder to get suppliers to join, the platform should subsidize suppliers first. This approach can lead to faster demand growth once the supply side is established.](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=96894ddabfada9a218b54a85aa0b270f2b950b92ce73520194830d128531a696JmltdHM9MTc1Nzg5NDQwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=20728943-00e2-6fae-31da-9f24018d6eaa&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9kc3BhY2UubWl0LmVkdS9iaXRzdHJlYW0vaGFuZGxlLzE3MjEuMS8xMzI4MTUvMTI2Mjk5MDYwOC1NSVQucGRm&ntb=1)
    - [**Creating Exclusive Access**: Restricting access to certain users can create a sense of exclusivity and encourage participation. However, this approach is less effective and should be used judiciously.](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=96894ddabfada9a218b54a85aa0b270f2b950b92ce73520194830d128531a696JmltdHM9MTc1Nzg5NDQwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=20728943-00e2-6fae-31da-9f24018d6eaa&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9kc3BhY2UubWl0LmVkdS9iaXRzdHJlYW0vaGFuZGxlLzE3MjEuMS8xMzI4MTUvMTI2Mjk5MDYwOC1NSVQucGRm&ntb=1)
    - [**Setting Geographic or Time Constraints**: Limiting the geographic area or the time frame for participation can increase engagement and participation. For instance, platforms can set a time constraint for bidding or a geographic constraint for users to join.](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=96894ddabfada9a218b54a85aa0b270f2b950b92ce73520194830d128531a696JmltdHM9MTc1Nzg5NDQwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=20728943-00e2-6fae-31da-9f24018d6eaa&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9kc3BhY2UubWl0LmVkdS9iaXRzdHJlYW0vaGFuZGxlLzE3MjEuMS8xMzI4MTUvMTI2Mjk5MDYwOC1NSVQucGRm&ntb=1)
    - [**Building a One-Sided Market**: Some platforms, like Poshmark, have successfully built a one-sided market where the majority of users are sellers, which can simplify the process of attracting buyers.](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=96894ddabfada9a218b54a85aa0b270f2b950b92ce73520194830d128531a696JmltdHM9MTc1Nzg5NDQwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=20728943-00e2-6fae-31da-9f24018d6eaa&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9kc3BhY2UubWl0LmVkdS9iaXRzdHJlYW0vaGFuZGxlLzE3MjEuMS8xMzI4MTUvMTI2Mjk5MDYwOC1NSVQucGRm&ntb=1)¬†These strategies can help platforms navigate the chicken-and-egg problem and achieve critical mass, leading to exponential growth and market dominance.
- Are you launching nationwide or starting with specific metro areas (LA, NYC, Atlanta)?
    
    Starting in Louisville with directly talking to users but reaching out to followers and other people on social media to widen our scope
    
- How do you ensure enough local inventory density so users find relevant gear nearby?
    
    Create a network of people for people to reach out to and always have gear available.
    
- What's your strategy for cold-start problem - incentivizing early listers before you have renters?
    
    Have them reach out to people that are also listing and rent from them. Reach out to people that don‚Äôt have great gear or always need a second cam to rent from.
    

## 5. **Social Feed Differentiation**

- The social component is interesting, but how does it drive actual rentals vs. just becoming another social network?
    
    Gear is listed in the posts where other users can rent directly from the post
    
- How do you ensure the feed promotes gear discovery and rentals, not just general photography content?
    
    They have to post the gear they used and if it is available for rent, that way every post is an opportunity for a sale.
    
- What specific features tie social engagement to rental behavior (gear tagging in posts, "shot with this setup" stories)?
    
    Yes
    
- How do you compete with creators' existing Instagram followings - why would they post here instead?
    
    They can make a passive income while not on a shoot or even promote their other handles.
    
    1. üõ°Ô∏è Trust & Insurance Model ‚Äì Make It Unshakable
    
    üîí Key Questions to Answer
    
    - **Who‚Äôs your insurance partner?**
    ‚Üí Research providers like *Atlaas*, *ShareGrid‚Äôs partnership with Athos*, or *InsuraTech startups* that offer API-based coverage.
    ‚Üí Decide: partner vs. build in-house (partnering is faster for MVP).
    - **What‚Äôs your claims process?**
    ‚Üí Draft a flow:
        1. Renter submits claim with timestamped photos.
        2. Platform mediates with insurance partner.
        3. Resolution within 72 hours.
        4. Escrow release or refund based on outcome.
    - **What‚Äôs your fraud prevention protocol?**
    ‚Üí Combine:
        - ID verification (Stripe Identity, Persona, etc.)
        - Timestamped gear photos pre/post rental
        - Community reviews + trust badges
        - Optional gear condition checklist
    - **What happens if a $10K camera is damaged?**
    ‚Üí You need a clear liability clause.
    - Insurance covers up to X amount.
    - Renter signs agreement.
    - Owner can opt into premium protection for high-value gear.
    
    2. üí∞ Revenue Model ‚Äì Defensible & Scalable
    
    üìä Unit Economics Breakdown
    
    | revenue stream | notes |
    | --- | --- |
    | 10% commission | split evenly between renter/rentee |
    | insurance add-on | optional, pass-through or markup |
    | boosted listings | paid visibilty for gear |
    | payment processing fee | stripe/paypal pass-through |
    | future gear sales | take % of transaction |
    
    üìà CAC vs. LTV
    
    - **CAC**: Low via community outreach, IG/TikTok, local events.
    - **LTV**: High if users rent 3‚Äì5x/year, list gear, and engage socially.
    
    You‚Äôll want to model:
    
    - Avg. rental price √ó frequency √ó retention
    - Cost per acquisition via paid vs. organic channels
    
    3. üåç Geographic Strategy ‚Äì Local First, Then Expand
    
    üß† Cold Start Playbook
    
    - **Supply-first strategy**: Get gear owners onboard with perks (free insurance, waived fees).
    - **Peer rentals**: Encourage early users to rent from each other.
    - **Referral loops**: Reward users for bringing in renters/listers.
    - **Local events**: Host meetups or workshops to build trust IRL.
    
    üìç Louisville Launch Strategy
    
    - Map out zip codes with high creator density.
    - Partner with local studios, colleges, and camera shops.
    - Create a ‚ÄúLouisville Founding Creators‚Äù badge for early adopters.
    
    4. üì£ Social Feed ‚Äì Make It Functional, Not Just Fun
    
    üîó Rental-Driven Engagement
    
    - **Gear tagging**: Every post must include gear used.
    - **‚ÄúShot with this setup‚Äù**: Auto-link gear to listing.
    - **Direct rental CTA**: ‚ÄúRent this setup‚Äù button on posts.
    - **Creator incentives**: Earn badges or discounts for gear-linked posts.
    
    üÜö Instagram Differentiation
    
    - **Monetization**: Creators can earn from gear, not just likes.
    - **Niche audience**: Photography-first, gear-focused.
    - **Discovery**: Posts tied to gear availability, not just aesthetics.
    
    You‚Äôre not competing with Instagram‚Äîyou‚Äôre giving creators a new way to monetize and connect through gear.
    

# Pitch Practice

üß≠ 1. Vision & Differentiation

**Q: What is your startup and why does it matter?**

We‚Äôre building a peer-to-peer camera gear rental platform with a social feed‚Äîthink Airbnb meets Instagram for creators. It empowers photographers and videographers to monetize idle gear, discover new setups, and showcase their work. We‚Äôre unlocking access to expensive equipment while building a creative community around it.

**Q: What makes you different from ShareGrid or KitSplit?**

We‚Äôre mobile-first, community-driven, and creator-centric. Unlike traditional rental platforms, we integrate a social feed where users can tag gear in their posts, making every photo a potential rental. Our commission is lower (10% vs. 15%), and we‚Äôre focused on accessibility, not just professionals.

üß± 2. Market & Demand

**Q: Who‚Äôs your target user?**

We serve three segments:

- Professionals with high-end gear looking for ROI
- Semi-pros who need upgrades for specific shoots
- Hobbyists who want to try before they buy
Each group benefits from access, income, and inspiration.

**Q: How do you know there‚Äôs demand?**

We‚Äôve validated interest through direct outreach, early signups, and social engagement. Creators are already renting informally‚Äîour platform formalizes that with trust, insurance, and discovery.

üîê 3. Trust, Safety & Insurance

**Q: How do you handle liability and trust?**

We use ID verification, trust badges, and user reviews to build credibility. For protection, we‚Äôre integrating third-party insurance to cover damage and theft, with a clear claims process and escrow-style payments.

**Q: What happens if a $10K camera is damaged?**

Owners opt into insurance coverage. If damage occurs, renters submit timestamped evidence, and we mediate with our insurance partner. Funds are held in escrow until resolution. We‚Äôre designing this to be fast, fair, and transparent.

üí∏ 4. Revenue & Business Model

**Q: How do you make money?**

We take a 10% commission‚Äî5% from the renter, 5% from the owner. Future revenue streams include boosted listings, insurance upsells, and gear sales. Our model scales with volume and community engagement.

**Q: What‚Äôs your CAC vs. LTV?**

CAC is low thanks to grassroots outreach and social virality. LTV is high‚Äîcreators rent multiple times per year, list gear, and engage socially. We‚Äôre building a sticky ecosystem, not just a transaction engine.

üìç 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

**Q: How do you solve the chicken-and-egg problem?**

We‚Äôre starting in Louisville with a supply-first strategy‚Äîonboarding gear owners through personal networks and incentivizing early rentals. We‚Äôre creating density before scale, and using social proof to drive demand.

**Q: Are you launching nationwide?**

Not yet. We‚Äôre focused on local density first. Once we prove traction in Louisville, we‚Äôll expand to other creator hubs like LA, NYC, and Atlanta.

üì£ 6. Social Feed & Community

**Q: Why include a social feed? Isn‚Äôt that a distraction?**

It‚Äôs a growth engine. Creators tag gear in their posts, making every image a rental opportunity. It drives discovery, builds trust, and keeps users engaged beyond transactions.

**Q: Why would creators post here instead of Instagram?**

Because here, their content earns. They can monetize gear directly, connect with renters, and build reputation in a niche community that values their craft‚Äînot just their aesthetics.

üß† 7. Team & Execution

**Q: Why you? Why now?**

I bring deep experience in system architecture, UI/UX, and building scalable, user-centered platforms. I‚Äôve shipped complex dashboards, solved SSR challenges in Next.js, and designed intuitive workflows that balance aesthetics with performance. I know how to move fast, iterate smart, and build products creators love.

My cofounder Landen is a professional photographer with firsthand experience of the pain points we‚Äôre solving. He‚Äôs rented gear, lent gear, and built a career around creative tools‚Äîhe knows exactly what creators need, what they fear, and what would make this platform indispensable.

Together, we blend technical precision with domain insight. We‚Äôre not guessing at this market‚Äîwe live in it. And we‚Äôre building the product we wish existed years ago.

## What people gripe about

1. **Voluntary Parting / Theft Risk**
    - ‚ÄúVoluntary parting‚Äù is a big concern: that means if a renter doesn‚Äôt return the gear (i.e. effectively steals it), the process to recover losses is weak or complicated. [Reddit+3Reddit+3Reddit+3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/16quqjd?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Some users feel the insurance / guarantee doesn‚Äôt fully cover their losses or has loopholes. [Reddit+3Reddit+3Reddit+3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/16quqjd?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Underpricing / Low Returns for Owners**
    - Owners often feel they don‚Äôt make enough money after accounting for time, wear and tear, prep (cleaning, maintenance), meeting renters, etc. [Reddit+2Reddit+2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/173wv35?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - There‚Äôs pressure to match or go below what others are charging (‚Äúa race to the bottom‚Äù) which drives prices down. [Reddit+2Reddit+2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/173wv35?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3. **Damage / Reimbursement Delays**
    - It seems some people have had damaged gear returned, sometimes in worse condition than expected, or missing pieces. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/lvskae?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Reimbursement (for damage) or getting insurance claims processed can take a long time. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1agfsoe?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
4. **Customer Service / Dispute Resolution Issues**
    - Some users claim ShareGrid isn‚Äôt helpful or responsive enough when gear isn‚Äôt returned, or when there‚Äôs a dispute. [Reddit+2Reddit+2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/f5bu9o?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Owners sometimes are upset over how ShareGrid decides to suspend accounts or resolve claims, especially when evidence is disputed. They feel decisions may be arbitrary or favor renters in some situations. [Better Business Bureau+1](https://www.bbb.org/us/wa/seattle/profile/photography-rentals/sharegrid-1296-1000055132/complaints?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
5. **Insurance / Guarantee Suspension or Limitations**
    - The ‚ÄúOwner Guarantee‚Äù (which is supposed to protect owners) was suspended at one point (during COVID-19) which upset people. [PetaPixel](https://petapixel.com/2020/07/31/sharegrid-quietly-suspends-owner-guarantee-that-protects-users-from-theft/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Limits on coverage (e.g. max value of gear, conditions) frustrate users. Some feel that coverage doesn‚Äôt address every kind of loss. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/14p38bu?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
6. **Same-Day Requests, Logistics, Availability**
    - Owners get annoyed by last-minute / same-day rental requests, which are harder to manage. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1cccbqk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Tied to that: pickup/drop-off scheduling, cleaning/checking gear between uses, ensure everything is returned in good condition. All this adds overhead that many feel isn‚Äôt sufficiently compensated. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/lvskae?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
7. **Marketplace Saturation / Competition**
    - In some markets there‚Äôs a glut of gear (especially camera bodies or lenses) so unless you own rare or high-demand equipment, you won‚Äôt get many rentals or you‚Äôll need to price low. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/14p37rp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Demand is inconsistent; owners report ‚Äúslow seasons‚Äù or low usage. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1cccbqk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
8. **Trust / Verification / Fraud Concerns**
    - Concerns about renters not being reliable, misrepresenting themselves, or using gear irresponsibly. [Reddit+2Reddit+2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1cccbqk?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Some issues around fraudulent listings or bad actors. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/f5bu9o?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
9. **Fees, Surcharges, Hidden Costs**
    - Some people say there are extra fees, charges, or ‚Äúdumb surcharges‚Äù that make the total cost higher than expected. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/f5bu9o?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Also, cost of time and effort (maintaining, cleaning, dealing with logistics) is often under-estimated. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/lvskae?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
10. **User Experience / Platform Issues**
    - Occasional website glitches or odd policy ambiguity; sometimes ‚ÄúRental Under Review‚Äù takes too long or lacks clarity. [support.sharegrid.com+1](https://support.sharegrid.com/en/articles/2239651-understanding-rental-under-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - Lack of control over who rents (in some cases) or feeling like policies favor renters. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/173wv35?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
