# Authentication Setup Guide

## Fixed Issues âœ…

1. **Environment Variable Issue**: Fixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNIN_ENABLED` to default to `true` instead of requiring explicit setting
2. **Signup Flow**: Users are now automatically signed in after account creation
3. **Email Verification**: Users can sign in immediately, with optional email verification via magic link

## Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with these variables:

```bash
# Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNIN_ENABLED=true

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database (replace with your actual database URL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/lensflare"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-here"

# Email (replace with your actual email configuration)
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
EMAIL_FROM="your-email@gmail.com"

# Google OAuth (replace with your actual Google credentials)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
```

## How the Auth Flow Works Now

### Signup Flow:
1. User enters email and password
2. Account is created with password hash
3. User is automatically signed in
4. User is redirected to `/app`
5. Optional magic link is sent for email verification

### Signin Flow:
1. User enters email and password
2. Password is verified against hash
3. User is signed in and redirected to `/app`

### Magic Link Flow:
1. User enters email
2. Magic link is sent to email
3. User clicks link to sign in
4. User is redirected to `/app`

## Testing

To test the authentication:

1. Make sure you have the required environment variables set
2. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
3. Navigate to `/sign-in`
4. Try the signup flow with a new email and password
5. You should be automatically signed in and redirected to `/app`

## Notes

- Users can sign in immediately after signup without email verification
- Email verification is optional and can be done later via magic link
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- All authentication methods (password, magic link, Google) are available
